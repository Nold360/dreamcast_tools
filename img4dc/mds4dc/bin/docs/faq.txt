Q: What's MDS4DC ?
A: MDS4DC is a new selfboot tool for your Dreamcast. It allows you to build MDS/MDF (Alcohol 120)
   images from an ISO, and if you want CDDA, from RAW tracks too.

Q: What's the difference between the "Audio/Data" and "Audio/Data with CDDA" image format ?
A: In "Audio/Data" you can't add CDDA tracks. The first session's only composed with one audio fake track.

Q: Can i use my WAV/MP3/Whatever to CDDA ?
A: The answer is yes *BUT* only if you convert your audio file to the RAW format, which means that your
   file is *NOT* compressed. You can use a tool such SOX (http://sox.sourceforge.net/) to do that.

Q: Hey, i built my MDS/MDF but it doesn't seems to be valid. What i'm doing wrong ?
A: If your image's invalid, you probably built the image in "Audio/Data with CDDA" mode. Your LBA (MSINFO)
   value for the second session (your DATA ISO) must be wrong. Did you use the lbacalc proggy correctly ?
   Please note that the order of your CDDA track's IMPORTANT! ("1.raw 2.raw" is *NOT* the same as "2.raw 1.raw").

Q: I have a Katana / WinCE game (official games) to selfboot... But i have a problem. Can you help me ?
A: Only if you have bought a new HSV ClubSport R8 for me.

Q: Can i create a GUI for your proggy ?
A: Of course yes. If you do so, send me a mail ;)

Q: Can i create a FAQ, burning guide, and so on in my native language ?
A: Yes! And if you do so, please send me a mail too !

Q: Can i host your tool ?
A: Of course yeah ! But don't forget to update it if needed.

Q: Can i test images built with this tool ?
A: Of course yes ! You can use both nullDC or Chankast (with a virtual drive) emulators.

Q: I really need another image format !!!
A: Mount your MDS/MDF to a virtual drive and make a disc copy (until the coming of my new selfboot tool :p)

Q: Why are you doing this ?
A: Cuz i love you ! Don't leave me noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow... *la la la*
