Nerorip takes a nero image file (.nrt extension) as input
and attempts to extract the track data as either ISO or audio data.

Usage: nerorip [OPTIONS]... [INPUT FILE] [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]

  Audio track saving options:
    -r, --raw           Save audio data as little endian raw data
    -c, --cda           Switches data to big endian and saves as RAW
    -a, --aiff          Switches data to big endian and saves as an AIFF file
    -s, --swap          Changes data between big and little endian (only affects --aiff and --cda)
  If omitted, Audio tracks will be exported as WAV files

  Data track saving options:
    -b, --bin           Export data directly out of image file
    -m, --mac           Convert data to "Mac" ISO/2056 format
  If omitted, Data tracks will be converted to ISO/2048 format.

  Data track trimming options:
    -t, --trim          Trim 2 sectors from the end of the first track
    -T, --trimall               Trim 2 sectors from the end of all tracks
    -f, --full          Do not cut any sectors from any tracks
  --trim and --trimall can be combined, resulting in 4 sectors being trimmed from the first track
  If omitted, only the first track will have 2 sectors trimmed.

  General options:
  -i, --info            Only disply information about the image file, do not rip
  -v, --verbose         Increment program verbosity by one tick
  -q, --quiet           Decrement program verbosity by one tick
                        Verbosity starts at 1, a verbosity of 0 will print nothing.
  -h, --help            Display this help message and exit
      --version         Output version information and exit.

If output directory is omitted, image data is put in the same directory as the input file.

For each track found in the image, nerorip will output the following:
  one iso file named "tdataTT.[iso/bin]" if the track is data and
  one wav file named "taudioTT.[wav/bin/cda/aiff]" if the track is audio
where TT is the track number.

For example, if your disc image is like the following
  Session 1:
    Track 1: Audio
    Track 2: Data
  Session 2:
    Track 1: Data
nerorip will output the following files:
  taudio01.wav, tdata02.iso, tdata03.iso
Note that the track number does not reset between sessions.

In many situations nerorip tries to act like cdirip. nerorip's session and track information output
follows a very similar style to cdirip so that nerorip can used using the same regex as cdirip.

Track trimming is present in this program to further that mimicing of cdirip's behavior. Like cdirip, 
by default the first track will be trimmed while the rest will be left alone. Unlike cdirip, trim and trimall
can actually be combined to have 4 sectors trimmed from the first track.
In general, it is not necessary to use the trim options. They are there in case the untrimmed tracks do not
fit on a regular CD-R because your burning software adds two sectors (which many do and cdrecord certainly does).

About the only feature present in cdirip that is not present in nerorip is the ability to move pretrack data
to the end of the previous track. This is unimplemented becaue I have had no need of it and I'm not convinced that
it is the best way to handle the pretrack data. If you really need this feature, let me know.
